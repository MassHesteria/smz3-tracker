**smz3-tracker** is a web-based utility for tracking items and locations within the [Super Metroid / A Link to the Past Crossover Randomizer](https://samus.link).

This tracker is hosted at [https://masshesteria.github.io/smz3-tracker](https://masshesteria.github.io/smz3-tracker) but can also be run locally simply by downloading the source code and opening the `index.htm` file in a browser.

## History

This is a fork of [http://github.com/miketrethewey/smalttpr-tracker/](http://github.com/miketrethewey/smalttpr-tracker/) which I started customizing for use at SG Live 2022. That project was a fork of a fork of [https://github.com/TestRunnerSRL/lttp-tracker](https://github.com/TestRunnerSRL/lttp-tracker) which appears to be a customized version of [https://github.com/crossproduct42/alttprandohelper](https://github.com/crossproduct42/alttprandohelper) written by [crossproduct](https://twitch.tv/crossproduct).

## Known Bugs

-  Doesn't keep inventory if you switch views
   -  To counteract this, open one tab for each game **then** start modifying settings
   -  Reloading either page will clear your inventory
